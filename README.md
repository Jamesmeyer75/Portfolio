# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio that has my favorite and most recent projects displayed. If you check out the code, I just
used Html, Css, and Jquery. I tried to structure my files in a MVC way, but without any backend. It also is fully
responsive using flexbox and media queries. As of now, my projects were done in a group and aren't responsive yet, but
something I hope to update soon.
